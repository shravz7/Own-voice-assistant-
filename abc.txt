or the individuals responsible for system maintenance do not understand the
system or the background to system design decisions. A lot of the effort dur-
ing the maintenance process is taken up with understanding the existing sys-
tem before implementing changes to it.

Contractual responsibility The contract to maintain a system is usually sepa-
rate from the system development contract. The maintenance contract may be
given to a different company rather than the original system developer. This
factor, along with the lack of team stability, means that there is no incentive
for a development team to write the software so that it is easy to change. If a
development team can cut comers to save effort during development, it is worth-
while for them to do so even if it means increasing maintenance costs.
